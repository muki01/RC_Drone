# üöÅRC Drone Project
This project features a drone control system developed based on the MultiWii software. It includes additional custom functions beyond the existing MultiWii capabilities.<br>

For an RC controller project using NRF24, check out [RC Controller Project](https://github.com/muki01/RC_Controller).

# Added Features
- NRF24 RF Module: Enables wireless communication between the drone and the RC controller.
- BMP280 Barometer Sensor: Gathers highly accurate barometric pressure and temperature data, which can be used for more precise altitude control of the drone.
- Adafruit Neopixel LED: Smart LEDs are mounted on the drone and can be controlled to display various light effects and color combinations.

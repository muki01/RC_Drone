# RC Drone Project
This project involves building a drone based on Multiwii. The drone communicates with the RC controller using the NRF24 RF module. Additionally, code has been integrated for the BMP280 barometer sensor and Adafruit Neopixel LEDs to control smart LEDs on the drone.

# Features
- NRF24 RF Module: Enables wireless communication between the drone and the RC controller.
- BMP280 Barometer Sensor: Gathers highly accurate barometric pressure and temperature data, which can be used for more precise altitude control of the drone.
- Adafruit Neopixel LED: Smart LEDs are mounted on the drone and can be controlled to display various light effects and color combinations.
